'''
Make dictionary from elements in index of lists
Write a function make_dict_from_elems_in_index that returns a dictionary consisting of a single key-value pair formed as follows:

the key is the element at the given index from the list keys.
the value is the element at the given index from the list values .
Assume the index is always within valid bounds for both lists.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

>>> keys = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
>>> values = [10, 20, 30, 40]
>>> make_dict_from_elems_in_index(keys, values, 1) 
{'banana': 20}
>>> make_dict_from_elems_in_index(keys, values, -1) 
{'cherry': 40}
Explanation

Elements of keys, values at index 1 are banana, 20 respectively. Hence the dictionary is {'banana': 20}
Elements of keys, values at index -1 are cherry, 40 respectively. Hence the dictionary is {'cherry': 40}
